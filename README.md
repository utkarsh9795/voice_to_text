# Voice to Text

## Project Overview

**Voice to Text** is a JavaScript-based application that allows users to convert spoken words into text in real-time. The application leverages the Web Speech API to provide seamless voice recognition and transcription capabilities. Additionally, it features a "Copy to Clipboard" functionality, enabling users to easily copy the transcribed text with a single click.

## Features

- **Real-time Voice Recognition**: Convert spoken words into text using the Web Speech API.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Recognizes speech in various languages (configurable based on user preference).
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy the transcribed text to the clipboard with a click of a button.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for ease of use.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different devices including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality for voice recognition and clipboard operations.
- **Web Speech API**: For speech recognition.
- **Clipboard API**: For copying text to the clipboard.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-to-text.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd voice-to-text
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser**.

4. **Usage Instructions**:
   - Click the "Start" button to begin voice recognition.
   - Speak clearly into your microphone. The spoken words will appear as text on the screen.
